                  My name is Dewald and I was born and raised in Cape Town
                  South-Africa. I finished High School in 1999 and have been
                  employed in various fields over the years. I spent some time
                  in London where I experienced different cultures and also did
                  a variety of interesting jobs. After I came back home to
                  South-Africa I enrolled for a Cullinary Cooking course which I
                  completed after also working full-time in restaurants and for catering companies. I then moved into
                  sales and more specifically retail. Currently I am employed as a
                  full time Sales Consultant in a high-end Jewellery store.<br>
                   
                  I enjoy working with other people and providing excellent
                  service to clients is a big passion for me. I decided to
                  enroll for an online Web Development course through <a href="https://www.hyperiondev.com/" >HyperionDev</a>  as a way to expose myself to the exciting field of web development. I enjoy the endless possibilities in creating something unique and beautiful. Creating a balance between simplicity, aesthetics and functionality is what inspires me.</p><br>

                  <h3>Education</h3>
                  <p>
                    Brackenfell High School Senior Certificate<br>
                    City and Guilds Diploma in Food Preparation and Cooking<br>
                    N4, N5 and N6 National Certificate in Business Management<br>
                    Currently enrolled in an online Web Development bootcamp at HyperionDev<br></p>
                  
                  <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                 <p> I have had a love for music since a very young age and started playing guitar when I was 14 years old. Over the years the guitar has become a great friend and is also amazingly therapeutic. Listening to music and discovering new artists has and will always be one of the great pleasures of life! Other than that I enjoy occasional cooking and recently discovered the art of baking bread. I also enjoy reading, watching unnecessarily complicated youtube talks on philosophy and working out with kettlebells.</p><br>
